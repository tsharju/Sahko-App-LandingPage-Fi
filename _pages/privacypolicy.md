# Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Electricity Prices app's website and apps for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV and any other devices and platforms.

## Information We Collect

Electricity Prices app uses Apple CloudKit to sync data between your Apple devices (iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch). Your data is stored in a private database, which is encrypted with an account-based key. Therefore, we do not have access to any data stored in your iCloud account.

You can revoke access to iCloud and delete all your data in the iOS Settings app on your iOS device. For more information visit Apple’s privacy policy: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy
